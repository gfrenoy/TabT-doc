It runs a demonstration database with anonymized resultats of some past seasons.  This database will also be used to illustrate this documentation.Main TabT conceptsTabT is defining the following main concepts:Member: a member is a single personClub: a club is an organisation grouping several membersTeam: a team is a group of members playing together against another teamMatch: a match is an event where two teams play against each otherDivision: a division is a group of teams playing a list of matchesCalendar: a calendar is the list of matches to be played within a divisionGame: a game is an event where two individual members play against each otherTournament: a tournament is an event where games between members are organised per categories",

    "content": "UploadIn order to allow other applications to send data into TabT, and to ensure interoperability with applications based on TabT data, an upload format is provided.This upload format is based on the use of simple text files that can easily be verified by humans.GeneralAn upload file is a text file composed of lines and columns.Line separator : line end (ASCII 13) or carriage return (ASCII 10 + ASCII 13)Column separator : semi column (;)First columnThe first column determines the type of information that will be sent to the server. It consists of one or two characters. Possible values are:  Line “C” : Heading or comments  Line “I” : Change in a result of a team match (aka interclub)  Line “TR” : Change in a tournament configuration  Line “T” : Change in a tournament result  Line “N” : Change in the new ranking of a player  Line “P” : Change in a player information  Line “L” : Change in a team match scheduleLine “C” : Heading or commentsThis line defines a free comment and is ignored.  The number and contents of the next columns are free.ExampleC;This is a free comment;With several columns;All ignoredLine “I” : Change in a result of a team match (aka interclub)With this line type interclub results are uploaded. It needs the following columns :  Season of the match ;  Match identifier ;  Home club ;  Visiting club ;  Home players list;  Visiting players list;SeasonThe identifier is a number which corresponds with a season:  5 = 2004-2005  6 = 2005-2006  7 = 2006-2007  etc.Match identifierUnique identifier of the match for which the results will be uploaded.This number is the same as the one given by the TabT application.ExamplesNH03/031, PWVLD09/183 or PVLBH17/019.Home clubHome club index or “bye” if the visiting team does not play a match this week (but still has to send a team composition).Visiting clubSame as home club but for the visiting club.Home players listThe list of affiliation numbers of the home players who play the match.This list consists of maximum four numbers of 6 characters, separated by a comma (,).If the player affiliation number is preceded by a dash (-), the player is W-O for all matches.
